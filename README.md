# NeuroChaT v1.2.0

NeuroChaT (RRID:SCR_018020) is an open-source neuron characterisation toolbox. It is described in our paper on [Wellcome Open Research](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/4-196).

## Installation

If you are on Windows, it is possible to use a Graphical version of neurochat, that can be downloaded as a single [executable file](https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT/releases/tag/v1.1.0).
Otherwise, Python version 3.5 upwards is required to install neurochat. Installation steps are listed in detail below:

### Option 1: Use Pip

Open command prompt and type/paste the following. It is recommended to install neurochat to a virtual environment (E.g. using virtualenv), if doing so, activate it before typing these commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT
cd NeuroChaT
pip install .
python cli.py
```

### Option 2: Use Docker

This option is aimed towards Linux users, and is not tested on Windows. Firstly, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), and then run the following in command prompt:

```
docker pull seankmartin/neurochat
xhost local:root
export QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1
docker run --volume /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --env DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY --name=neurochat seankmartin/neurochat
```

To access your host data in the Docker container, mount the data in the run command, like so
```
docker run --mount type=bind,source=/home/username/my-data,target=/mnt/my-data --volume /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --env DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY --name=neurochat seankmartin/neurochat
```
To build a docker image of the master branch, instead of running `docker pull`, run the below command, and replace seankmartin/neurochat by neurochat:master

```
git clone https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT
cd NeuroChaT
docker build -t neurochat:master .
```


### Option 3: Use Pip, but don't install NeuroChaT

Open command prompt and type/paste the following.

```
git clone https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT
cd NeuroChaT
pip install -r requirements.txt
python modify_neuro_path.py
python cli.py
```

This method only allows the GUI program to function, any other file will need to modify the python path to use neurochat.


### Option 4: Use `conda`

It is also possible to install *NeuroChaT* into a `conda` (Anaconda) environment

```
git clone https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT
cd NeuroChaT
conda create -f environment.yml
pip install .
python cli.py
```

### Install PyQt5 on linux

If you are running NeuroChaT GUI on linux, after installing the requirements you will need to install further qt programs.
Most likely, you only need `python3-pyqt5`, but just in case it might be safest to install all three of these if you have the available disk space.

```
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
sudo apt-get install pyqt5-dev-tools
sudo apt-get install qttools5-dev-tools
```

## Getting Started

The best ways to get started with NeuroChaT are:

1. For using the UI, download the [executable file for Windows](https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT/releases/tag/v1.1.0) and check out the [user manual](https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT/blob/master/docs/NeuroChaT%20User%20Guide.pdf).
2. For using the Python Code, checkout the nice [notebook](https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT/blob/master/notebooks/api_use_guide.ipynb) made by Md Nurul Islam, a [repository](https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT_API_Scripts) containing a set of scripts using NeuroChat by Sean Martin, and [examples](https://github.com/seankmartin/NeuroChaT/tree/master/examples) in this repository.

We are open to collaborators, questions, etc. so feel free to get in touch!

## Documentation

See our [Read the docs website](https://neurochat.readthedocs.io) for documentation and examples.

## Open Science Framework Storage

Sample hdf5 datasets and results are stored on OSF, at https://osf.io/kqz8b/files/.

## Version

The NeuroChaT version number should be maintained in:

1. `setup.py`
2. `neurochat\__init__.py`
3. `README.md`

## Troubleshooting

If you are trying to run NeuroChaT from Python source code, and are having problems, the first port of call should be to install the requirements from fixed_requirements.txt instead of the normal source.

## Current known bugs
1. From the GUI, if an LFP file is analysed, and then a subsequent LFP file is attempted to be loaded but fails - the program returns the results for the first LFP file analysed. This should be a relatively simple fix. This may only happen for 0 length LFP files, but needs further testing.
2. Loading a config file with mode set to 2 fails to correctly load the excel file, but loads the parameters correctly.
